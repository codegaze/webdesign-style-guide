# Website Design Style Guide

Over the years I 've worked with some designers, some of them are organised some of them are not. 

I find it useful to give them this guide before or even after they 've finished prototyping their product to provide me with all the information I need to deliver a project.

This is a guide I use for everyday small projects with agencies, a contest, a mini site etc,  please send PRs with what you think will make this a real thing.
